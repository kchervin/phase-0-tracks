What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned that you can create snippets in sublime, which are extremely helpful in terms of saving time and having code ready to be used and edited.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

the most challenging is trying to understand the purpose of each tag and how it is useful.  I know the more that I create, the better I will understand each tag. I am still learning how to research and find answers - and understand how to apply it to my own code  -->
