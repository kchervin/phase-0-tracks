//create a function that takes a string as a parameter adn reverses the string.
//create variable to store reversed string
 //iterate through each letter of the string - starting with the last index.  for each index that is greater than or equal to zero, loop through and decrement (i--) after each iteration. so starting with reversed_string = "" + the letter at index 0.  Reversed_string is equal to this new letter, and builds as reversed string is equal that letter plus the next changed letter, as reversed_string + string[0] for each letter at ever index.
 // Add driver code that calls the function in order to reverse a string of your choice (as long as it's not a palindrome!), and stores the result of the function in a variable.
// Add driver code that prints the variable if some condition is true. The condition can be a silly one, like 1 == 1.
