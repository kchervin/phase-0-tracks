# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control lets you save your work at different stages and protects your software.  If mistakes are made, you can roll back and see the work as it progressed and refer to an older version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch allows edits of software to be made without touching the original version.  Multiple changes can be made to a project and then merged to the original, so multiple people can work on different parts of a project at the same time. You can experiment and work on a project without worrying about ruining it.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

a commit creates a save point in git.  a good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

branching allows people to work on a similar project independently and merge them back to an original version.  however, sometimes, independent workers can change the same part of the original, and git does not know which one is the correct change to integrate.
